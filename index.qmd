# Preface {.unnumbered}

> This book is under development, and the table of contents may change.

This book is about tools and techniques for finding and understanding anomalies. We will begin with some simple data sets containing only one variable, and build up slowly to much more complicated data. We will cover popular but inadvisable methods to identify anomalies (pointing out their shortcomings), as well as more reliable and recommended approaches.

The book is written for two audiences: (1)&nbsp;people finding themselves doing data analysis without having had formal training in anomaly detection; and (2)&nbsp;students studying statistics or data science.

You will need a knowledge of statistics and probability at about second year undergraduate level. So if you've done a couple of statistics subjects, and are familiar with multiple regression, hypothesis tests and probability distributions, then you should be prepared for what follows. This book takes a probabilistic approach to anomaly detection, and so probability distributions are particularly important. This is the subject of Chapters @sec-univariate and @sec-multivariate. You will also need some knowledge of matrix algebra; the most important matrix results that we use are provided in @sec-appendix.

Finally, you will need to know how to use R and be familiar with the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`. There are many online resources that cover this material, including @r4ds and the [StartR](https://startr.numbat.space/) self-learning modules we have developed at Monash University.

All R examples in the book assume that you have loaded the [`weird` package](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/weird-package/) first. You will need to have version 2.0.0 or later.

```{r}
#| label: library
#| code-fold: false
library(weird)
```

This loads the relevant data sets, and various other packages needed to reproduce the examples.
